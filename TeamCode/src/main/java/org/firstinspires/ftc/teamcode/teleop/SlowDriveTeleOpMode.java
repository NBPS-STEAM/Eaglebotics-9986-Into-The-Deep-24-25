/*
 * This file contains a "OpMode" for driving a robot.
 * An OpMode (Operation Mode) is a 'program' that runs in either the autonomous or the teleop period of an FTC match.
 * The OpMode to use can be selected on the FTC Driver Station.
 *
 * Hardware names are listed in the Constants file. You must correctly set all hardware names for each
 * motor/servo/etc. in the Driver Station for the code to find your devices.
 *
 * This code uses gamepad controls to drive slowly. The driving is field-centric. That's it.
 *
 *
 * The initialize() method runs when the "init" button is pressed on the Driver Station.
 * Everything afterward is handled by commands.
 *
 *
 *
 * Robot controls:
 * Controller 1:
 * Left stick           |   Drive robot (strafe)
 * Right stick          |   Drive robot (turn)
 *
 *
 * Tips:
 * If you don't understand what a particular method does, then hover your mouse over it to get some info and a short description.
 * If you click on a variable/method, then all uses of it in the file will be highlighted.
 * Click on a variable/method and press Ctrl+B (Cmd+B on mac) to be taken to where it was originally declared.
 * In addition, do that twice for a list of everywhere that variable/method is used.
 * You can also do that by holding ctrl while you click on the variable/method.
