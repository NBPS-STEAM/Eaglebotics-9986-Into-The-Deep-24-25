If you're interested in using Road Runner, see the instructions in AutonomousRoutine instead.

This roadrunner folder contains files needed for Road Runner to work. It's not a part of SUPRA and
you don't need to look at or modify (seriously, don't modify) any of the code here to use Road
Runner. In fact, if you do touch any of these files, it will probably break things. If you need to
fix these files, either revert the changes with Git or just redownload the files from the Road
Runner website.

You may need to modify one or more of these files to set hardware names. If you replace these files
with the originals, make sure to update the hardware names. Also, if necessary, add ".roadrunner" to
the 'package' line at the top of each file (you can also put the files in the teamcode folder and
then drag the files into the roadrunner folder to have Android Studio "refactor" it automatically).
